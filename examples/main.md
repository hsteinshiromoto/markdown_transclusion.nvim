# Markdown Transclusion Example

This is a main document that will demonstrate how transclusion works.

## Basic Transclusion

Here's a simple transclusion of another file:

![[child1]]

## Nested Transclusion

The child1 file above also transcludes another file. This demonstrates nested transclusion.

## Custom Path Transclusion

We can also include files from subdirectories:

![[subfolder/child2]]
